# Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly looking to improve my skills and deepen my understanding of various programming languages and development environments. For this project, I aimed to further my knowledge of Kotlin by creating a small console application. This software is designed to demonstrate basic input/output operations and string manipulation, providing a simple yet effective way to practice Kotlin syntax and functionality.

# Development Environment

Used Tools:
1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
A lightweight, cross-platform code editor by Microsoft with extensive extensions for programming.

2. Java Development Kit (JDK)
The software development environment required to run and compile Java/Kotlin code (Kotlin runs on the JVM).

3. Kotlin Language
A modern, statically-typed programming language that interoperates with Java, mainly used for Android/JVM development.

4. Kotlin Extension for VS Code
Official VS Code plugin (by fwcd.kotlin) that adds syntax highlighting, code completion, and basic Kotlin support.

5. Kotlin Compiler (kotlinc)
The command-line tool that converts Kotlin code into executable JVM bytecode

Kotlin is a modern, statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is designed to be concise, expressive, and safe, while maintaining full interoperability with Java
