# Overview
Kotlin Scheduling App 


As a software engineer, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and deepen my understanding of programming languages and development environments. For this project, I chose to explore Kotlin, a modern and expressive language, by building a console-based scheduling application.

This application allows users to manage their academic schedule, including adding courses, setting class times, and tracking upcoming tests. It supports various input features, handles invalid entries gracefully, and detects time conflicts between scheduled classes. The purpose of this project was to solidify my Kotlin fundamentals while building a practical tool.

Features
Add and manage courses (code, name, instructor)

Schedule class times for each course

View daily schedules

Register and display upcoming tests

Input validation for dates, times, and weekdays

Automatic detection of time conflicts between classes

# Development Environment

Used Tools:
1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
A lightweight, cross-platform code editor by Microsoft with extensive extensions for programming.

2. Java Development Kit (JDK)
The software development environment required to run and compile Java/Kotlin code (Kotlin runs on the JVM).

3. Kotlin Language
A modern, statically-typed programming language that interoperates with Java, mainly used for Android/JVM development.

4. Kotlin Extension for VS Code
Official VS Code plugin (by fwcd.kotlin) that adds syntax highlighting, code completion, and basic Kotlin support.

5. Kotlin Compiler (kotlinc)
The command-line tool that converts Kotlin code into executable JVM bytecode

Kotlin is a modern, statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is designed to be concise, expressive, and safe, while maintaining full interoperability with Java
